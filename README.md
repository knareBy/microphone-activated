# microphone-activated
This is a simple program that plays the voice line "Microphone activated" or "Microphone muted" every time you press a specified keybind.
I made it because it is difficult to distinguish between the mute and un-mute sounds in Discord.
The voice files were generated with www.voicemaker.in
You can change them to whatever you want as long as you name them microphone_activated.wav and microphone_muted.wav
